## 🧬 About the Game of Life

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway in 1970. It's a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

Rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies (underpopulation)
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies (overpopulation)
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell (reproduction)
